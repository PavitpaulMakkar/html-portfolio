<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Pavitpaul Makkar and I am a rising junior at the University of Florida pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Biomedical Engineering. I am passionate about the applications of biomechanical solutions and medical devices to improve patient recovery and quality of life. From July 2023 - December 2023, I will be joining Arthrex as a Manufacturing Engineering Co-op. My role involves supporting design teams in medical device manufacturing, drafting documentation, executing process validations, and optimizing manufacturing methods. I am excited to develop my technical skillset and grow as a professional.

<p>I am also actively involved as a youth leader within the community. In 2018, I founded The Sikh Youth Association, a nonprofit organization focused on promoting ethnocultural awareness and youth volunteerism. We work with local businesses, community groups, and municipalities to host our Annual "Unity in Diversity" 5K. We also coordinate a food and clothing drive for our military veterans and their families</p>

<p>I am always pushing myself to learn new skills and add to my technical skillset. As such, I am excited to invite you guys along on my journey into web development! </p>
